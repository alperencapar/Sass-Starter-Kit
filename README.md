# SASS/SCSS Boiler / SASS/SCSS Starter Kit

Sass, Bootstrap, PostCSS and Vite starter pack. Styles are only for example/testing. You can delete styles, after you're clone the repo.

## SASS File Structure (7-1 Pattern)

### abstracts

-   abstracts contains no actual styles, just Sass mechanisms that help define styles in other directories (sometimes called "helpers"/"utilities"). This includes things like global variables, functions, and mixins. Each of these categories should be placed in their own appropriately-named partial file.

### vendors

-   vendors contains any third-party stylesheets a project uses. For instance, if we wanted to use Bootstrap alongside our own custom Sass in a project, we'd download the Bootstrap stylesheet and place it here.

### base / core

-   base contains boilerplate used throughout an entire si te. This includes project-wide typography styles, and stylesheets that universally reset or normalize default CSS.

### layout

-   layout contains styles for different aspects of the site's structural layout (think of areas like nav bars, headers, footers, etc.)

### components

-   components are like "mini" layouts. Styles for small, reusable pieces of the site should reside here (think buttons, forms, profile pictures, etc.)

### pages

-   pages is where page-specific styles reside. For instance, if a project contained several style rules that are only ever used on the "Contact Us" page, they'd live here in a \_contact.scss file, as seen above.

### themes

-   themes is used whenever a site has multiple themes. For instance, the example project above includes both admin and default themes. We can therefore assume this example site is styled entirely differently for logged-in admins. Perhaps to better present and accommodate the additional features an Admin has. Some websites also offer a "night mode", where the background of the site is darker with lighter-colored text for easier reading in low-light environments. An option like this would be represented in its own theme file too.
